HEY RECOMMENDIANS!!

Recommendin is a website which is a solution to the problem that is “which movie is next???”. It provides you with the best movie’s recommendations according to your taste.
This website is mainly based on three types of algorithms weighted hybrid, weighted average and nearest neighbor.
Weighted average - 

 


Weighted hybrid-  Hybrid technique used in this work is weighted technique in which the prediction score is combination linear of scores gained by techniques that are combined.

Nearest neighbor-
 

Collaborative Filtering
This filtration strategy is based on the combination of the user’s behavior and comparing and contrasting that with other users’ behavior in the database. The history of all users plays an important role in this algorithm. The main difference between content-based filtering and collaborative filtering that in the latter, the interaction of all users with the items influences the recommendation algorithm while for content-based filtering only the concerned user’s data is taken into account.
There are multiple ways to implement collaborative filtering but the main concept to be grasped is that in collaborative filtering multiple user’s data influences the outcome of the recommendation. and doesn’t depend on only one user’s data for modeling.
